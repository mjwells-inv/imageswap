			<h2>What do you see where there should be an image?</h2>
			After the page has finished loading, what do you see? If there are mixed results, you should usually be able to base your approach on the least functional images.<p>

			<br><b>Nothing:</b> Not even a broken image icon. This can happen when an image is set as the background. Since there is nothing to right click on, it is harder to find the URL in these cases.<br>
			<br><i>Note: this option's results are all the same as the results for "Broken image icon." Only some minor wording is different.</i><p>

			<br><b>Broken image icon:</b> There might be an empty frame with the icon inside or just the icon. The icon might have the name of the image next to it or might be all alone.
			<br><div style="border: 2px solid #808b96; border-radius: 10px; margin-top:-10px; margin-left:65px; margin-right:100px; padding:7px; font-size:0.9em;"><b>Edge case note:</b> Image host error images like these (with text saying an image doesn't exist or can't be found) can also be counted under "Broken image icon."

			<br><b>Obvious placeholder:</b> This would be something like a box with a word in the middle. If in doubt, count it as an actual image.<p>

			<br><b>Actual image:</b> Any image that successfully loads and isn't an obvious placeholder.<p>
			
			<br><br><h2>What is the image URL?</h2>

			To find out, right click on the image or broken image icon and use "inspect" or "copy image address."<p>
			If there is nothing to right-click on, you can use "inspect" to look for a URL within the style header (click the arrow next to "head" and then "style"). If there's nothing obvious there, try viewing the source code (<b>ctrl+u</b>) and using <b>ctrl+f</b> to search for some key terms. If you search for <b>"http"</b> you'll find any URLs; just be aware that they might not always be for images. Also, if you search for <b>"data:image"</b> it should turn up any attempt to use a Base64 encoded image.<p>
			<br><i>Note: If you use <a href="https://mjwells-inv.github.io/imageswap/swap.html" target="_blank">Michael Wells's Media Replacer</a>, it will change the URLs used. You need to answer this question based on the URLs in the original version of the webpage. The Media Replacer will also tell you the URLs that were replaced from the original page.</i><p> 
			 
			<br><b>URL is itself a placeholder:</b> This is not an attempt to insert a placeholder image. This is when the webpage code includes a made-up file name or URL (like “photo1.jpg” or “https://mybusiness.com/mylogo.png”) that isn't supposed to work. It's just supposed to show the user where to put the real URL or file name. If a URL is clearly intended to be a made-up placeholder, treat it like a placeholder URL, even if the URL/domain also happens to be real (like the "mybusiness.com" example above, or any time an "example.com" URL is used).<br>
			<br><i>Note:A local file name like "photo1.jpg" will show up as "photo1.jpg" when you use "inspect" or look in the source code. However, if you use "copy image address," it will look like "https://featherstorageprod-xxxxx.azurefd.net/assets/photo1.jpg". So if you see a "featherstorage" URL, a placeholder file name was probably used.</i><p> 

			<br><b>Base64 string:</b> Encoding in Base64 is a way of including an image directly as part of the html. Where the URL would normally be, instead there would be something like "url('data:image/jpeg;base64," followed by a long string of jumbled up characters.<p>

			<br><b>Link to image placeholder website:</b> Choose this if the URL links to a website that is primarily and explicitly intended to provide placeholder images. The option applies for both working sites and sites that were known placeholder image providers but are no longer available/reliable.<p>
			Some common active placeholder image websites:
			<ul>
				<li>placehold.co</li>
				<li>loremflickr.com</li>
				<li>picsum.photos (Lorem Picsum)</li>
				<li>placehold.jp</li>
				<li>fakeimg.pl</li>
				<li>images.placeholders.dev</li>
				<li>dummyimage.com</li>
				<li>placebear.com</li>
				<li>i.pravatar.cc (Profile/avatar pictures)</li>
			</ul>
			Some known dead (or dying) placeholder image websites:
			<ul>
				<li>via.placeholder.com</li>
				<li>placekitten.com</li>
				<li>placedog.com</li>
			</ul>	

			<br><b>Link to any other website / Other:</b> Choose this if the URL links to any website that is not primarily and explicitly intended to provide placeholder images. This includes free photo/media websites such as commons.wikimedia.org, unsplash.com, and pixabay.com because they are not primarily intended for providing placeholders.<br><p>

			<br><b>The "/ Other" part:</b> The <a href="https://mjwells-inv.github.io/imageswap/swap.html" target="_blank">Media Replacer</a> can identify some additional fringe cases and give instructions about how they should be classified. However, if you encounter a situation that doesn't seem to fit anywhere else, you can choose this as a fallback option.<p><p>

			


			<br><br><h2>Does the completion text say that placeholders were used?</h2>
			We have been told that any time placeholders are used, the completion text must explain to the user that placeholders were used. The text does not need to use the word "placeholder." Any statement that an image URL or file name can or must be replaced by the user should count as a "yes," and <b>Ctrl+f</b> searching for the word "replace" is often the quickest way to find placeholder explanations.<p>   
			<br><b>Yes:</b> We are not currently evaluating the quality or accuracy of the completion text, so choose "yes" if the completion text states that placeholders were used for images, even if part of the statement (such as the source of the placeholder images) isn't accurate.<p>
			<br><b>No:</b> Choose this if the text doesn't state that the user can or should replace the included images with their own. If the completion includes only a webpage link and no additional text, that always counts as a "no."<p>

			<br><br><h2>General guidelines for failure to acknowledge placeholders</h2> 
			Failure to acknowledge placeholders in the completion text should be considered a minor flaw. It may negatively affect functionality scores above 4, but it should never push a 4 down to a 3 or have any effect on scores below 4.<br> 
			(However, it can always be used as an overall rating tie-breaker if there aren’t more significant differences to consider.)
